# DHT Sensor Comparison

Open chart.html to visualize the CSV data in `serial.csv`.

Data is from three sensors connected to an Arduino Sensor Shield, which is connected to a LinkIt One. Goal was to compare two DHT11 sensors with a DHT22 sensor.

Code for testing is in `test.ino`. This code relies on [my fork of the Adafruit DHT Sensor Library](https://github.com/GeoSensorWebLab/DHT-sensor-library).
